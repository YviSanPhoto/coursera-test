					It was many and many a year ago,
          			In a kingdom by the sea,
				    That a maiden there lived whom you may know
				    By the name of ANNABEL LEE;
				    And this maiden she lived with no other thought
				    Than to love and be loved by me.

					Ah, broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever! Let the bell toll!- a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river; And, Guy de Vere, hast thou no tear?- weep now or nevermore! See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!

					Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door."'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door-  Only this, and nothing more."</p>
